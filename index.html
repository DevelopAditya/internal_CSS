<h1>Major Animal Phyla & Their Characteristics</h1><br><br>
<h3>Phylum Porifera</h3><br><image src="download.jpg" height=250 width=350 align=right>
<p>Phylum Porifera is made up of sea sponges, which are stationary plant-like organisms we find in colorful coral reefs. But sea sponges are actually basic filter feeding animals, meaning they strain water in through their walls to capture food. They also have no definite shape, nor do they have a body cavity, like the space our organs are contained in. They're simply made of a few layers of cells organized into a column.</p><br>
<p>Sponges are characterized by the possession of a feeding system unique among animals. Poriferans don't have mouths; instead, they have tiny pores in their outer walls through which water is drawn. Cells in the sponge walls filter goodies from the water as the water is pumped through the body and out other larger openings. The flow of water through the sponge is unidirectional, driven by the beating of flagella which line the surface of chambers connected by a series of canals. Sponge cells perform a variety of bodily functions and appear to be more independent of each other than are the cells of other animals.</p><br><br>
<h3>Phylum Cnidaria</h3><br><image src="images.jpg" height=250 width=350 align=right>
<p>Phylum Cnidaria consists of jellyfish and hydras, which are squishy animals that have a more complex feeding system than Porifera. Most have some sort of tentacle with stinging cells, called cnidocytes, that can capture small prey. These organisms also have a basic nervous system called a nerve net but no brain or conscious thought. They can, however, sense their environment and respond to it.They have two basic body forms: swimming medusae and sessile polyps, both of which are radially symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes. Both forms have a single orifice and body cavity that are used for digestion and respiration. Many cnidarian species produce colonies that are single organisms composed of medusa-like or polyp-like zooids, or both (hence they are trimorphic). Cnidarians' activities are coordinated by a decentralized nerve net and simple receptors. Several free-swimming species of Cubozoa and Scyphozoa possess balance-sensing statocysts, and some have simple eyes. Not all cnidarians reproduce sexually, with many species having complex life cycles of asexual polyp stages and sexual medusae. Some, however, omit either the polyp or the medusa stage.</p><br>
<p>Cnidarians were formerly grouped with ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata, but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Cnidarians are classified into four main groups: the almost wholly sessile Anthozoa (sea anemones, corals, sea pens); swimming Scyphozoa (jellyfish); Cubozoa (box jellies); and Hydrozoa, a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members, such as Hydra, and colonial swimmers, such as the Portuguese Man o' War. Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa were only firmly recognized as cnidarians in 2007.</p><br><br>
<h3>Phylum Platyhelminthes</h3><br><image src="20.jpg" height=250 width=350 align=right>
<p>Phylum Platyhelminthes is made up of flatworms, which have a flattened body with an incomplete digestive tract like Poriferans and Cnidarians, meaning the mouth is the same opening as the anus. The most well-known member of Platyhelminthes is the planarian, a common model animal in biology known for its ability to regenerate its body, even after being cut into many pieces.Platyhelminthes very commonly known as flatworms or tapeworms, these animals are soft-bodied invertebrate animals. There are around 20,000 species of these animals. A few of these live as parasites on humans and other animals. It is because of this parasitic nature that they do cause some amount of trouble for the host animal. A few species belonging to this phylum can be a major cause of certain diseases. Schistosomiasis, or bilharzia or bilharziasis, is a disease caused by these parasitic flatworms belonging to the family Schistosomatidae.</p><br>
<p>The most distinguishing feature of these invertebrates is their flat body. As the body does not have any cavity, they are flat. The body is also not segmented and they do not have specialized systems. Around eighty percent of the flatworms are parasitic in nature, while a few free-form flatworms are also present. The free-living species are scavengers or predators. The parasitic species feed on the tissues of the host organism in which they live. The animals in this phylum have a diverse range in size. Some are microscopic, while a few go up to two feet long. They are also hermaphrodites, which mean that both the sexes are present in the same organism.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Phylum Nematoda</h3><br><image src="21.jpg" height=250 width=350 align=right>
<p>Phylum Nematoda includes the round worms, which have a complete digestive system, a new feature in animal evolution, meaning they have separate holes for the mouth and anus. Nematodes are mostly free living, but some parasitic nematodes are more well-known to humans. The species Trichinella spiralis causes the illness trichinosis, which is transmitted by eating infected pork.Nematode species can be difficult to distinguish from one another. Consequently, estimates of the number of nematode species described to date vary by author and may change rapidly over time. A 2013 survey of animal biodiversity published in the mega journal Zootaxa puts this figure at over 25,000. Estimates of the total number of extant species are subject to even greater variation. A widely reference article published in 1993 estimated there may be over 1 million species of nematode, a claim which has since been repeated in numerous publications, without additional investigation, in an attempt to accentuate the importance and ubiquity of nematodes in the global ecosystem (rather than as a sign of agreement with the estimated taxonomic figure). Many other publications have since vigorously refuted this claim on the grounds that it is unsupported by fact, and is the result of speculation and sensationalism. More recent, fact-based estimates have placed the true figure closer to 40,000 species worldwide.</p><br>
<p>Nematodes have successfully adapted to nearly every ecosystem: from marine (salt) to fresh water, soils, from the polar regions to the tropics, as well as the highest to the lowest of elevations. They are ubiquitous in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial environments, where they often outnumber other animals in both individual and species counts, and are found in locations as diverse as mountains, deserts, and oceanic trenches. They are found in every part of the earth's lithosphere, even at great depths, 0.9–3.6 km (3,000–12,000 ft) below the surface of the Earth in gold mines in South Africa. They represent 90% of all animals on the ocean floor. Their numerical dominance, often exceeding a million individuals per square meter and accounting for about 80% of all individual animals on earth, their diversity of lifecycles, and their presence at various trophic levels point to an important role in many ecosystems. The roughly 2,271 genera are placed in 256 families. The many parasitic forms include pathogens in most plants and animals. A third of the genera occur as parasites of vertebrates; about 35 nematode species occur in humans.</p><br><br>
<h3>Phylum Annelida</h3><br><image src="22.jpg" height=250 width=350 align=right>
<p>Phylum Annelida includes our classic, segmented worms, like the ones birds eat from the ground. Annelids have a complete digestive system, and even have specialized organs within it, like the intestine, esophagus, crop, and gizzard. They also have a closed circulatory system where blood is enclosed in vessels like ours as well as basic excretory organs to remove waste.Annelida is a group commonly referred to as segmented worms, and they are found worldwide from the deepest marine sediments to the soils in our city parks and yards. Through most of the 20th century Annelida was split into three major groups; Polychaeta, Oligochaeta (earthworms etc.) and Hirudinea (leeches). Earthworms and leeches are the familiar annelids for most people, but polychaetes comprise the bulk of the diversity of Annelida and are found in nearly every marine habitat, from intertidal algal mats downwards. There are even pelagic polychaetes that swim or drift, preying on other plankton, and a few groups occurring in fresh water and moist terrestrial surroundings. Around 9000 species of polychaetes are currently recognized with several thousand more names in synonymy, and the overall systematics of the group remains unstable (Rouse and Pleijel, 2001).</p><br>
<p>A distinctive feature of annelids are structures called chaetae. Chaetae (also called setae) are bundles of chitinous, thin-walled cylinders held together by sclerotinized protein. They are produced by a microvillar border of certain invaginated epidermal cells and so can be defined as cuticular structures that develop within epidermal follicles. Chaetae show a huge amount of variation, from long thin filaments (capillary chaetae) to stout multi-pronged hooks. Apart from annelids, chaetae are found in Echiura and Brachiopoda. There is now good evidence (Hessling and Westheide, 2002; McHugh, 1997) that the former group falls within Annelida. The position of Brachiopoda is controversial (Lüter, 2000b; Lüter and Bartolomaeus, 1997; Stechmann and Schlegel, 1999) and the homology of their chaetae with those of annelids is unresolved (Lüter, 2000a). There is a distinct possibility therefore that chaetae represent an apomorphy for Annelida.</p><br><br>
<h3>Phylum Arthropoda</h3><br><br><image src="23.jpg" height=250 width=350 align=right>
<p>Phlyum Arthropoda is made up of all of the creepy crawly animals such as spiders, centipedes, bees, scorpions, and even insects like praying mantises and butterflies. Surprisingly, crustaceans like crabs and lobsters are also arthropods. If you look closely, you can see the similarities, including: An exoskeleton, or outer shell body segments, and antennae. Arthropods have a complete digestive system but not a closed circulatory system. Their nutrients simply move around the body in a liquid called hemolymph.Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80 per cent of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most other animals, are very successful in dry environments. Arthropods range in size from the microscopic crustacean Stygotantulus up to the Japanese spider crab. Arthropods' primary internal cavity is a haemocoel, which accommodates their internal organs, and through which their haemolymph – analogue of blood – circulates; they have open circulatory systems. Like their exteriors, the internal organs of arthropods are generally built of repeated segments. Their nervous system is "ladder-like", with paired ventral nerve cords running through all segments and forming paired ganglia in each segment.</p><br>
<p>Their heads are formed by fusion of varying numbers of segments, and their brains are formed by fusion of the ganglia of these segments and encircle the esophagus. The respiratory and excretory systems of arthropods vary, depending as much on their environment as on the subphylum to which they belong. Their vision relies on various combinations of compound eyes and pigment-pit ocelli: in most species the ocelli can only detect the direction from which light is coming, and the compound eyes are the main source of information, but the main eyes of spiders are ocelli that can form images and, in a few cases, can swivel to track prey. Arthropods also have a wide range of chemical and mechanical sensors, mostly based on modifications of the many setae (bristles) that project through their cuticles. Arthropods' methods of reproduction and development are diverse; all terrestrial species use internal fertilization, but this is often by indirect transfer of the sperm via an appendage or the ground, rather than by direct injection.</p><br><br>
<h3>Phylum Mollusca</h3><br><image src="24.jpg" height=250 width=350 align=right>
<p>Phylum Mollusca consists of the soft squids, sea snails, clams, cuttlefish, and octopi of the ocean, as well as snails and slugs on land. Most of the animals are protected by a hard shell as you can see on clams and snails. But some of the sea mollusks have other adaptations to survive. Octopi are one of the smartest invertebrates, or organisms without a backbone. They have a well-developed nervous system with a complex brain, and are able to learn puzzles and use new techniques to capture prey. These organisms are built for speed with a closed circulatory system and quickly run down prey, using their razor sharp beaks and poison to kill. Many octopi employ camouflage as well for extra stalking abilities.Molluscs are the largest marine phylum, comprising about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 8 or 9 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish and octopus, are among the most neurologically advanced of all invertebrates—and either the giant squid or the colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous molluscs and account for 80% of the total classified species.</p><br>
<p>Molluscs have been and still are an important food source for anatomically modern humans. There is a risk of food poisoning from toxins which can accumulate in certain molluscs under specific conditions, however, and because of this, many countries have regulations to reduce this risk. Molluscs have, for centuries, also been the source of important luxury goods, notably pearls, mother of pearl, Tyrian purple dye, and sea silk. Their shells have also been used as money in some preindustrial societies. Mollusc species can also represent hazards or pests for human activities. The bite of the blue-ringed octopus is often fatal, and that of Octopus apollyon causes inflammation that can last for over a month. Stings from a few species of large tropical cone shells can also kill, but their sophisticated, though easily produced, venoms have become important tools in neurological research. Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis or snail fever) is transmitted to humans via water snail hosts, and affects about 200 million people. Snails and slugs can also be serious agricultural pests, and accidental or deliberate introduction of some snail species into new environments has seriously damaged some ecosystems.</p><br><br>
<h3>Phylum Echinodermata</h3><br><image src="25.jpeg" height=250 width=350 align=right>
<p>Phylum Echinodermata may look morphologically (structure and form) dissimilar at a glance, but they all share the same characteristic features. These animals have some really unique shapes and have beautiful colours. They are important ecologically and geologically, as they provide valuable clues about the geological environment.Echinoderms are marine animals and can be found in the depths of the ocean as well as in the intertidal zone. An interesting feature of this phylum is that all animals belonging to Echinodermata are marine.Echinodermata may look morphologically (structure and form) dissimilar at a glance, but they all share the same characteristic features. These animals have some really unique shapes and have beautiful colours. They are important ecologically and geologically, as they provide valuable clues about the geological environment.</p><br>
<p>Echinoderms are marine animals and can be found in the depths of the ocean as well as in the intertidal zone. An interesting feature of this phylum is that all animals belonging to Echinodermata are marine. There are no freshwater or terrestrial organisms in this phylum. Water vascular system present in the echinoderms is a unique circulatory system. This accounts for the gaseous exchange, circulation of nutrients, waste elimination as well as locomotion. This system has a central ring canal and radial canals that extend along each arm. Through these structures, water circulates. The madreporite is a structure present on top of the body. This is responsible for regulation of the water in the water vascular system.</p><br><br>
<h3>Phylum Chordata</h3><br><image src="26.jpg" height=250 width=350 align=right>
<p>This phylum is probably the most notable phylum, as all human beings and other animals and birds that are known to you, fall under this phylum. The most distinguishing character that all animals belonging to this phylum have is the presence of notochord.It will surprise you but this phylum is a very diverse phylum, with about 43,000 species. Most of these organisms can be found in the subphylum Vertebrata. In the animal kingdom, this is considered as the third largest phylum.Taxonomically, the phylum includes the following subphyla: the Vertebrata, which consists of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals; the Tunicata, which includes salps and sea squirts; and lastly the Cephalochordata, which includes the lancelets. There are also additional extinct taxa such as the Vetulicolia. The Vertebrata are sometimes considered as a subgroup of the clade Craniata, which is consisting of chordates with an already formed skull; the Craniata and Tunicata compose the clade Olfactores.</p><br>
<p>Of the more than 65,000 living species of chordates, about half are bony fish that are members of the superclass Osteichthyes. The world's largest and fastest animals, the blue whale and peregrine falcon respectively, are chordates, as are humans. Fossil chordates are known from at least as early as the Cambrian explosion. Hemichordata, which includes the acorn worms, has been presented as a fourth chordate subphylum, but it now is usually treated as a separate phylum. The Hemichordata, along with the Echinodermata (which includes starfish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and crinoids), form the Ambulacraria, the sister taxon of the Chordates. The Chordata and Ambulacraria form the superphylum Deuterostomia, composed of the deuterostomes.</p>
